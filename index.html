		<h2>WHAT IS PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES? </h2>
		<p>
	
			A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical rules for
			instructing a computer or computing device to perform specific tasks. 
			The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages.
			Each programming language has a unique set of keywords (words that it understands)
			and a special syntax for organizing program instructions.

		<h2> HIGH LEVEL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES </h2>

			<p>
		
				High-level programming languages, while simple compared to human languages, 
				are more complex than the languages the computer actually understands,
				called machine languages. Each different type of CPU has its own unique machine language.
				<br>
				<br>
				Lying between machine languages and high-level languages are languages called assembly languages.
				Assembly languages are similar to machine languages, but they are much easier to program in 
				because they allow a programmer to substitute names for numbers. Machine languages consist of numbers only.
				<br>
				<br>
				Lying above high-level languages are languages called fourth-generation languages (usually abbreviated 4GL).
				<br>
				4GLs are far removed from machine languages and represent the class of computer languages closest to human languages.

		<h2>HOW ARE PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES USED ON WEBSITES ?</h2>
		
			<p>
				Programming languages have numerous different functions,
				but like human communication, these languages are used to
				allow us to talk to your website.
				<br>
				Different parts of the website (text, images, design elements, 
				links, etc.) speak different languages. In order to communicate
				to the website what it needs to do, we use the appropriate language.
