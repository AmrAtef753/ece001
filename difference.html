				<th>Differences</th>
				<td>The C++ language has an object 
				oriented structure which is used in
				large projects. Programmers can
				collaborate one program into different
				parts or even one individual work on
				each part of the program. The structure 
				of object oriented also permit code to
				be reused many times.This language is an 
				efficient language. But, many programmers will disagree</td>
				<td>The C language is a  basic programming 
				language and it is a very popular language, 
				particularly used in game programming, Because
				C language includes the additional packing of 
				the C++, Every programmer uses this language
				because it makes programs faster . However 
				the value of this language gives the reusability 
				of C++ to get the slight increase in performance with C language.</td>
				<td>Pascal language is mostly a teaching language
				and few industries uses this language to write 
				the programs. This language tends to use keywords
				instead of symbols and braces in C language. So
				this language is very easy for beginners to understand
				than a programming language like C, C++. Borland is a
				compiler software company, which is using Delphi programming
				language for industrial strength. Delphi is an object 
				oriented language of Pascal, and presently  Borland compilers only use it.</td>
				<td>Fortran language is a number crunching language
				and still it is used by scientists. This language
				allows different sizes of variables up to the memory
				limit in the machine. This language is suitable for 
				engineers, who have to calculate values with high precision. 
				Program in Fortran is inflexible and sometimes it makes difficult to read.</td>
				<td>The Java language is a multi platform language thatâ€™s 
				particularly helpful in networking. Of course, mostly this
				language is used on the web with Java applets. However,
				this language is used to design cross platform programs,
				Since it similar to C++ in structure and syntax. For C++ 
				programmers, Java language is very easy to learn and it 
				offers some advantages provided by object oriented  programming.
				Like reusability and it can be difficult to write efficient
				code in Java. But, nowadays the speed of the Java language 
				has increased and 1.5 version offers some good features for 
				easy program making.</td>
				<td>Perl language is a file management language for UNIX.
				But it is more popular for its common gateway interface
				programming (CGI). It is a term for programs that web 
				servers can perform to allow additional capabilities of 
				web pages. Pearl language is a method for searching text
				and it is used for useful server functions and other 
				databases, and it is very easy to pick up the fundamentals
				if you have any experience in any language. As a CGi
				language, web hosting services select Perl language over 
				C++ language. Because, the web hosts can review Perl 
				script files. Since they are text files, when C++ is compiled.</td>
				<td>The PHP language is used to design web pages 
				and sometimes it is also used as scripting language. 
				This language is designed to develop a rapid website,
				and as a result comprises features which make it easy
				generate HTTP headers and link to databases. As a scripting 
				language, it includes a set of components permit the 
				programmer to easily get up to speed. However, it has 
				more  sophisticated object oriented features.</td>
